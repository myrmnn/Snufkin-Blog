     <h3>Adding A Navigation Bar</h3>
     <time datetime="2019-10-26">October 26, 2019</time>
    </header>
<p>
Yesterday I played around adding in a navigation bar. I did this by making an unordered list (<q>&lt;ul&gt;</q>) and then making them into links, placing them all in a <q>&lt;nav&gt;</q> tag and using CSS to stylize it. 
<br>
I would like to figure out how to center everything and make it responsive, still so much to learn!
<br>
I also started using markups like <q>&lt;time&gt;</q>, <q>&lt;article&gt;</q>, and <q>&lt;header&gt;</q>.
<br>
I am on chapter 12 of the book I am working through and getting close to finished, I am actually excited to get to learning how to make proper forms. I stopped the projects on <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.com</a> because I wasn't confident with the material yet to complete the projects. After reading though <span class="italic">Head First HTML and CSS</span> I feel I am able to better understand the concepts taught in the modules on free code camp.

<h3>Do Not Worry</h3>

<h4>Do Not Worry Matthew 6:25-34</h4>
<p>
25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[e]?

28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 
<br><br>
<p><em>34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</em></p>

<h3>October 16, 2019 Liquid Frozen Jello</h3>
<p>
<h4>Layout and positioning chapter</h4>
<ul>
<li>A liquid layout is one in which the content of the page expands to fit the page when you expand the browser window.</li>
<li>A frozen layout is one in which the width of the content is fixed, and it doesn't expand or shrink with the browser window. This has the advantage of providing you more control over you design, but at the cost of not using the browser width as efficiently.</li>
<li>A jello layout is one in which the content width is fixed, but the margins expand and shrink with the browser window. A jello layout usually places the content in the center of the page. This has the same advantages as the frozen layout, but is often more attractive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>October 12, 2019</h3>

Getting further along in the CSS chapter of the book has been fun and informative! I have started playing around with a small project using things I have learned in Chapter 9, "The Box Model." Once it is done I will create a link somewhere on the page. I would like to learn how to create a navigation bar that is fixed and have different projects linked there. So much to learn, :D!
<br><br>
In that project I played around with giving elements two classes so as not to repeat style rules.
<br><br>
Below I have made a div of a list of things I want to remember from Chapter 9 and I styled it. I am now on Chapter 10 and learning more about divs. I knew what divs were before but reading this chapter on them really helps me understand their purpose: to logically group sections of a page together. Now I understand why there are so many divs used, say, in creating a form!

<div class="bullets">
<h4>Chapter 9 <q>Bullet Points</q></h4>
<ul>
<li>CSS uses a box model to control how elements are used.</li>
<li>Boxes consist of the content area and optional padding, border, and margin.</li>
<li>The content area contains the content of the element. The padding is used to create visual space around the element. The border surrounds the padding and content and provides a way to visually separate the content. The margin surrounds the border, padding, and content, and allows space to be added between the element and other elements. These are all optional.</li>
<li>Use the background-position and background-repeat properties to set the background image.</li>
<li>Use the class attribute to style elements together as a group, and use the id attribute to give an element a unique name. You can also use the id attribute to provide a unique style for an element. There should only be one element in a page with a given id. Select elements using their id selector, #.</li>
<li>An element can only have one id but it can belong to many classes.</li>
<li>You can have more than one stylesheet in your HTML, if two stylesheets have conflicting property definitions , the style sheet that is last in the HTML file will receive preference.</li>
<li>You can target devices by using media queries in you link element or the @media rule in your CSS.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>October 8, 2019 snufkin.css</h3>
<p>
In the first chapter of the CSS section of my book I learned how to create a separate file for the styling. I then made a snufkin.css file in my "Snufkin Codes" folder and copy/pasted all of my style rules that I had in style at the top of my HTML within the head tags. Now all the rules for the CSS are in their own separate place! 
<br><br>
Today I also moved the picture of Snufkin to the top of the page and made it into a link, if you want to know who Snufkin is, go ahead and click the link to find out!

<h3>October 7, 2019 - Finishing HTML, on to CSS!</h3>
<p>
Today I got half way through the book I am using as a learning tool in addition to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org" title="Learn to code for free!" target=_blank >freecodecamp.org</a>. The title of the book is called Head First HTML and CSS. Its an older book but it is still relevant and the learning style is working well with me. I really needed something in addition to online learning and this book has been fun to work through. I finished the HTML portion and am now on to learning CSS (again). 
<br>
<h4>Things I enjoyed learning in the HTML part of the book</h4>
<ul>
<li>How to resize images to make thumbnails and turn them into links.</li>
<li>Giving titles to links so they give a short description</li>
<li>The proper way to start HTML documents with doctype, character setting, and language attributes. Other things like putting alt attributes into img tags I found helpful.</li>
<li>It may sound simple but re-learning about organizing files into different folders was helpful to me. Doing this early on in the development of a website makes sense to me to make the process easier down the road. Finding paths through folders and using <q>..</q> to direct to a parent folder was new to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<blockquote>
<q>A relative path is a link that points to other files on your website relative to the web page you're linking from. Just like on a map, the destination is relative to the starting point.</q>
</blockquote>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Being careful to always nest elements correctly.</li>
<li>I like the suggestion for drawing out a design on paper before writing the code.</li>
<li>target=_blank for opening links in new windows instead of the existing open window!! </li>
</ul>
<h4>Some things I still have questions about. </h4>
<ol>
<li>Such as, how to indent the beginnings of paragraphs? </li>
<li>I would like to figure out why I am having trouble changing the font (it could be something to do with a font preference I have on Linux). </li>
<li>This probably will be addressed in CSS but I would like to add a navigation bar with links to other pages within this blog. I remember learning something about a nav tag, but I haven't used it yet except when doing tutorials. Tutorials are fun but I don't retain much of what I learn. It's better for me to work on basics and build from there. </li>
</ol>

<h3>October 6, 2019 - Ampersands, lists, and thumbnails.</h3>
<p>
Today I played around with putting a link at the bottom of the first entry that will bring you back to the top of the page. I used the id "snufkin" for the image below the main heading to do this. At first I was having trouble but then realized I needed to put the complete path to the folder and not just start with the end document and then the id. **edit**10/23/19** you can just use the image id instead of the whole path!
</p>
<br>
&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; I wanted to try out placing an ampersand symbol!
<br><br>
I do love making lists...
<ul>
<li>unordered</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>of things</li>
    <ol>
<li>ordered</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>of things</li>
<li>within</li>
<li>unordered things</li>
    </ol>
<li>more</li>
<li>unordered</li>
<li>things</li>
</ul>
**edit**10/23/19** You're not supposed to put ordered lists inside of unordered lists!
<hr>
I took a picture of this tree near where I live. Click on the thumbnail and it will link you to a page with a larger view of it.

<h3>October 5, 2019 - A responsive picture, centered.</h3>
<p>
Today, I have added an image to the top of my blog. I struggled at first with trying to make it responsive when I resized the window but it seems that I have succeeded! A quick Google search provided the answer, </p>
<p><blockquote>
#snufkin {<br>
display:flex;<br>
border:;<br>
border-radius:;<br>
margin-right:auto;<br>
margin-left:auto;<br>
width:70%;<br>
height:auto;<br>
}<br>

<h3>October 4, 2019 - Starting my journey :)</h3>
<p>
About a month ago I couldn't write a line of code. I still feel like I can't write a line of code, but here we are at the beginning taking baby steps to who knows where. This whole learning to code thing happened very organically. I have been seeing a therapist for a few months with the intention of trying to find a clear path forward. I have never really known <q>what I wanted to be when I grew up</q>, I have tried many things and failed miserabley. Seeking help in this area seemed like a productive thing to do and one of the things we talked about was the subject of past hobbies. Out of nowhere the memory of playing around with coding popped into my mind. I had forgotten all about it and in fact did not even realize at the time that that's what I was doing. Really, I was just playing around with HTML blindly, I didn't even know it was called HTML. I would tweak the look of pages on geocities for no reason what-so-ever and ultimately I think their purpose was to serve as a memory for me to look back on now. I think at the time I thought I was going to create websites for my different interests, perhaps an online journal. The point of it though was that it was something I spontaneously did and enjoyed, why not pick it back up?
</p>
<p>
I went home after uncovering that memory and thought about it to myself. I wondered if I could learn to do it again. I would have to start from scratch because I remembered nothing. A few days into this memory my husband (without any kind of prompting from me) told me that he had been listening to podcasts about studying web developement and that he wanted to start learning online using a website called <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org" title="Learn to code for free!" target=_blank>freeCodeCamp.org</a>. I told him about my conversation with my therapist and a few days later we started learning to code together. That was about a month ago and it's exciting to look back and see how much I've learned in that time. I still have so much to learn and, actually, that kind of excites me!
</p>
<p>
This little project is for, at least at this point in time, a place for me to write about what I am learning and to practice using what I learn in whatever way it can be implemented in a blog. The structure and design of it I want to be something that I create from scratch on my own, no matter how basic it looks to begin with. 
</p>
<p>
I'm excited to see where this trail takes me! At the moment my internet connection decided to quit so I am truly playing around with the design of this with just my memory. So far I have changed up the look of this using the code below. If you told me a month ago that I would understand this I would have looked at it and said, <q>Cool! What is it?</q>
